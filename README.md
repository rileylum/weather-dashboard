# Weather Dashboard

## Description
A webapp that displays weather data for your city!

In this project I have used bootstrap to style the page, OpenWeatherAPI and Javascript to dynamically generate the content (including using localStorage to have saved data persist between page refreshes) and DayJS to get the current time.

![The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions for Adelaide.](./assets/img/webapp-screengrab.png)

## Usage

Enter a city name into the search bar and click submit. Weather forecast data will populate the page. 

Previous searches will populate the sidebar (and persist between pageloads), simply click on the button to get the data for that city again.

The completed website can be viewed at: https://rileylum.github.io/weather-dashboard/
